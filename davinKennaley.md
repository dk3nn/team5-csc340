## About Me
Hello I'm Davin Kennaley, I'm an out of state student from Massachusetts, about 30 minutes north of Boston. I live off campus with my girlfriend and our 3 dogs. When I'm not spending time with those 4 or doing homework I like to play video games, watch sports, golf with my friends, read, and watch movies and shows.

## My CSC 340 Goals
In this class I hope to broaden my understanding of software engineering, learn about different processes within it, and improve my own skills.
