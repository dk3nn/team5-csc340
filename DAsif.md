## About Me
    I’m an undergraduate Computer Science student with a strong interest in technology and programming. I enjoy learning about coding, algorithms, and building software. I’m always looking to improve my skills and take on new challenges. I love working on projects and discovering new things in tech. I’m excited to keep learning and growing in the world of computer science!

## My CSC340 Goals
    I’m really excited to be in CSC340. I’m looking forward to learning how to build real software and understand the steps needed to make a working product. I am also excited to that we will learn how to work well with a team, because I know teamwork is important when making software. I hope this class will help me become a better programmer and team player.
